# Little Penguin

42 school project: This "challenge" is a series of Linux kernel programming assignments starting out small,
and in the end, if all goes well, you’ll be the maintainer of a subsystem, if you so desire.
Well, maybe not a maintainer, but you will be qualified enough to point out any problems
that your favorite maintainer is causing, and that’s actually way more fun than being in
charge.
